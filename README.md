LibiCode
========

Simple my-first-programming toy. Try it out: http://winterwell.com/daniel/game/doodle.html


Warning: The code is a quick hack!

Suggested Improvements:

 - Switch to canvas for drawing instead of html. Benefits: rotate about doodle centre.

 - Refactor into MVC pattern, perhaps using backbone or angular.js.
